# Customer/ Product Analytics
# Objectives of the Project
The primary objectives of this project were to:

Understand Customer Behavior: Analyze customer purchasing patterns and behaviors, focusing particularly on their interactions with different product segments.
Clean and Standardize Product Names: Standardize product names to ensure consistency and accuracy in the data analysis.
Segment Analysis: Examine customer segments based on demographic and behavioral attributes such as lifestage and premium customer status.
Transaction and Sales Analysis: Investigate transaction frequencies, total sales, and average units bought to derive actionable insights.
Price Analysis: Compare average prices per unit across different customer segments and conduct statistical tests to identify significant differences.

# What Was Achieved
Product Name Standardization:

Cleaned product names by removing digits and special characters and correcting spellings using fuzzy matching techniques.
Identified and removed irrelevant products (e.g., Salsa).
Customer Segmentation:

Grouped customers by lifestage and premium status, allowing for targeted analysis of customer behavior.

Transaction Analysis:

Calculated the number of unique dates and total transactions, providing a broad overview of the transaction data.
Analyzed transaction counts over time, enabling the identification of trends and patterns.
Sales Analysis:

Visualized total sales and number of customers by segment using bar plots.
Calculated average units of chips bought per customer segment.
Price Analysis:

Calculated average prices per unit of chips for different customer segments.
Conducted t-tests to compare average prices between various segments, identifying statistically significant differences.

# Recommended Marketing Strategies:

Targeted Promotions: Use insights from customer segments to design targeted marketing campaigns. For example, segments with higher average units per purchase could be offered bulk purchase discounts.
Premium Segment Focus: Since there are significant differences in spending behavior between mainstream and premium/budget customers, tailor promotional strategies accordingly.

Product Offerings: Consider expanding product lines that are popular among high-value segments. For instance, introducing new flavors or package sizes of chips that appeal to premium customers.
Price Adjustments: Based on the price sensitivity observed in different segments, adjust pricing strategies to maximize sales without alienating budget-conscious customers.
Customer Retention:

Loyalty Programs: Develop and enhance loyalty programs focusing on high-value customer segments such as midage singles/couples and young singles/couples, providing personalized offers and rewards.
Further Analysis:

Deeper Segmentation: Conduct more granular segmentation, perhaps by geographic regions or shopping behavior (e.g., online vs. in-store purchases), to uncover additional insights.
Predictive Modeling: Implement predictive models to forecast customer behavior and sales trends, enabling proactive decision-making.
Data Quality and Maintenance:

Regular Data Cleaning: Establish a regular data cleaning process to maintain the quality and consistency of product names and other critical data attributes.
Missing Data Handling: Implement strategies for handling missing data more effectively to ensure comprehensive analysis.
